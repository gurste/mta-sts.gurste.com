# MTA-STS configuration

This repository hosts the MTA-STS configuration for Gurste.com. It's public so that we can use GitHub Pages to host it and is unlikely to be of any use to people outside of Gurste.

## Deployment

As detailed above, we host our configuration on GitHub Pages which is configured in [_config.yml](./_config.yml) and use a custom domain which is configured in [CNAME](./CNAME).

To deploy an update to the configuration, merge a PR into the `main` branch of this repository and it will be live immediately. It may take up to a fortnight for the update to be used by all email servers.
